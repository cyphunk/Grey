Grey
====

When run this application removes all color from OSX. You can selectively turn color back on for 5 minutes using Cmd+Shift+C hotkey.

Why? I built this around the same time as [NetworkGamma](https://github.com/cyphunk/NetworkGamma). I was interested how limiting UI aesthetics may effect the development of the UI structure. After running this application almost continuously for over a year I started to appreciate deadspace much more. Text menus feel more natural than cluttered icons. The question of what meaning an icon is able to relay becomes more prevalent. Where skimophism is applied starts to hurt almost physically.

I intended to extend this to monitor what windows are in focus and track the age of unfocus. With this in place one could imagine unfocused windows fadind slowly over time giving a natural window layout that keeps related elements in color while those that have gone stale faded.
